Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. AI encompasses a range of technologies, from basic rule-based systems to advanced machine learning models that can analyze large datasets and make autonomous decisions. The ultimate goal of AI is to create systems capable of perceiving, reasoning, learning, and interacting with the world in ways that mimic or even surpass human abilities.
